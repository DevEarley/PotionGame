		<h1>Rules</h1>
		<div id="rules-card-container" class="card-container">
			<h2>Basics</h2>
			<br>- Players start with 1 card of each type.
			<br>- You must follow the rules on each card.
			<br>- Players talk to each other and try to get themselves cured.
			<br>- Players guess each other's cards' descriptions. 1 point per card.

			<h2>Getting Points</h2>
			<br>- When a player is cured, their cards are now up for grabs and are worth 1 point each.
			<br>- Only when the player is cured, each player has a chance for guessing.
			<br>- The player that triggered the cure gets to guess first.
			<br>- When the player guesses correctly, they hold the discarded card as a point. (It's effect is not in play.)
			<br>- The game is over once everyone is cured or bored.
