			<h2>Basics</h2>
			- Players start with 1 card of each type.
			- You must follow the rules on each card.

			<h2>Geting Points</h2>
			- When a player is cured, their cards are now up for grabs and are worth 1 point each.
			- Only when the player is cured, each player has a chance for guessing.
			- The player that triggered the cure gets to guess first.
			- When the player guesses correctly, they hold the discarded card as a point. (It's effect is not in play.)
			- The game is over once everyone is cured or bored.

			<h2>Using a D20 to play</h2>
			- Players take turns rolling a D20.
			- If they roll lower than 15, they may make a statement or ask a question to try to get other players to
			cure them. Then they pass the dice.
			- If they roll 15 or more, they can say or ask up to 3 things. Then they pass the dice.

			<h2>Using a timer.</h2>
			- Set the timer for 60 seconds.
			- Any player can speak or ask a question during this time.
			- If a player is cured, reset the timer for 60 seconds.
			- If no players were cured after the timer finises, set the timer for another 60 seconds.
			- During this time, all players are cured and players try to guess.
